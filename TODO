Things you can do if you want to help:

 - Rename all files and functions name to use the empathy namespace.
 - Porting gossip-account-widget-*.{c,h} from gossip project (Guillaume is already working on IRC widget).
 - Make a EmpathyTpChatroom object inherited from EmpathyTpChat and adding support for topic, invite, members list, etc.
 - Porting various UI widgets from gossip to libempathy-gtk for contact info, adding contact, personal info, etc.
 - GtkWidget-ify gossip widgets imported in libempathy-gtk. Actually most window/dialog do not inherit from GtkWindow/GtkDialog...
 - Set up the translation system and import po files from gossip? Or re-translate everything?
 - Fix setting subscription for contacts in EmpathyContactList.
 - Write a MC plugin to filter channels before dispatching them. For example we need a GtkStatusIcon that blink when an event arrives (text/voip/ft channel) and tells the MC to dispatch the channel only when the user clicked the icon. Like in gossip.
 - Testing and Bugfixing.

SoC projects:
 - Adding VoIP support based on the patch proposed for gossip.
 - Adding FileTransfer support.
