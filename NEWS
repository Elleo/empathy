NEW in 0.4:
==============
 - contact list refactoring: EmpathyContactList is an iface implemented by
   EmpathyTpContactList, EmpathyContactManager and EmpathyTpChatroom.
   GossipContactList splitted into GossipContactListStore and
   GossipContactListView, it can display any object implementing the
   EmpathyContactList iface. Make possible to set custom functions to define
   the groups of a contact, by default it gets the "group" property of the
   GossipContact object. This make possible to reuse the contact list UI from
   the main window for chatrooms where groups are the role/affiliation of the
   contact on that room.
 - Auto away when gnome-screensaver says the session is idle and extended away
   30min after that.
 - Display ChatState when the contact is composing.
 - Bugbuddy now reports crashes to GNOME Bugzilla.
 - New program icon.
 - Setting i18n support and importing po files from gossip.
 - Add an example label for jid.
 - Do not open chat window twice for the same conversation.
