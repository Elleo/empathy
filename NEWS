NEW in 0.4:
===========

   GossipContactListView, it can display any object implementing the
   EmpathyContactList iface. Make possible to set custom functions to define
   the groups of a contact, by default it gets the "group" property of the
   GossipContact object. This make possible to reuse the contact list UI from
   the main window for chatrooms where groups are the role/affiliation of the
   contact on that room.
